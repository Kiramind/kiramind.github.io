						<a href=./Hex/web/index.html><h3>Hex-Periment</h3></a>
						<p>
This is a little project experimenting with hexes, pathfinding, line of sight and the Dart programming language.
</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This projects is presented as a pseudo game displaying, on a hex map, the best path between a character and a treasure chest. This path is computed according to the ground type of each hex on the map. The map can be modified with several ground type (mountain, hill, sand...) associated with different value, updating the best path on the fly.
<br/>
Moreover, the game offers the possibility to display a realistic vision range of the character. For example, a character on top of a hill will see further than one circled by mountains. This vision is also taken into account to compute the best path.
<br/>
Finally, coins can be placed on the map, affecting the best path relatively to the value the character gives to it. Several type ofcharacter with different levels of greed are available to test this behavior.
All these features are explained directly on the page when clicking on the "info" button.
</p>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>
First, this project made me work with interesting algorithms. An A-star algorithm for the pathfinding and a line of sight algorithm for the vision range.
<br/>
Moreover I had to apply these algorithms in the context of hexes. A lot of basic function like converting a clicked location to hex coordinate,  involved converting cartesian coordinates to hex coordinates. 
<br/>
Finally, it was an opportunity for me to work with the Dart programming language, wich is a nice a modern alternative to the typeless JavaScript.

						<a href=./LastFmLookup/index.html><h3>LastFM Lookup</h3></a>
						<p>
This project is based on the LastFM API, and allows to find what are the last 50 tracks of an artist listened by a user. 
<br/>
For those who don't know it, LastFM is a service that allows to record all the music tracks listened on any device.
<br/>
We use this project with my friend because we make each other discover a new artist every Friday (we call it #listeningFriday) and it allows us to find what artist the others already know.
