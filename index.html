						<p>
This is a funny experiment with Hexes. As a board game enthusiasts, I always appreciated how hexes give a new range of possibilities compared to squares.</br>
This little program allowed me to implement mathematical computations in a Hex world among which : A-star pathfinding, line of sight algorithm. Moreover, it was an opportunity to try the Dart language for the first time.
Please try playing modifying the maps, character and visibility in order to see the pathfinding in action.<br/>
You can have a better understanding of the possibilities offered by this experiment, by clicking on the little "Info" buttons.

						<p>
This application is a little web app based on LastFM to find what music my friend listen to. If you don't know it, LastFM is a music website that offers to record all tracks listened on many devices and softwars. From this data it makes recommandation and it also provide an API to access your data and public data from all users.
I use this website to retrieve the last 50 tracks listened by a LastFM user. Since we are often making eachother discover music with friends, we use this application to know if somebody has already listen to tracks from a given artist.
